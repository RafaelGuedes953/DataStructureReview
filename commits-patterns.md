# Commit message patterns
In this document, the standard structure for the commit messages is defined.

The structure to be followed is:

```type: <message>```

# Message 'types'
- **feat**: for new features that are added.
- **fix**: used to fix a problem found.
- **docs**: something related to documentations, README, among others.
- **refactor**: if it is necessary to change or improve something.
- **perf**: when working on something performance related.
- **chore**: it works for things related to build, configs, installing new dependencies or updating packages.

# Example:
```
git commit -m "docs: update pattern readme"
```
